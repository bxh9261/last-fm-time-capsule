# Last FM Time Capsule

[TRY IT NOW](https://people.rit.edu/bxh9261/230/project2/)

Reads data from the [last.fm api](https://www.last.fm/api/) to give the user the top songs they've listened to in any given month.

Created by Brad Hanel and Nick Schnering.

# Known Issues

[last.fm removed the ability to use any audiovisual content on their api](https://getsatisfaction.com/lastfm/topics/api-announcement-dac8oefw5vrxq) so all artist images now show as stars. Looking for a new way to correct this while abiding by last.fm's new terms.
